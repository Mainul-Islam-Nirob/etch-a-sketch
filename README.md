## My process
Hello, this is my 4th project here in The Odin Project. It's a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. It was a little challenging at first but finally I made it. At first the cod was messy later I have refactored the code and reduced redundancy.

### Built with

- Grid
- Javascript
- DOM

### What I learned
